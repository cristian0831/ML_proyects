# Differents number and sizes for convolutional layers
Increasing the number of filters for convolutional layer the test accuracy increase and the test loss is reduced. Allowing increase the size of the layer, that is, the kernel matrix the loss is higher.
# Different pool sizes for pooling layers
Increasing the pool size improve mainly the test loss, the test accuracy is slighly lower.
# Different numbers and sizes of hidden layers
Increasing the number of hidden layers the both the test accuracy and test loss is worsened.
# Adding a dropout 
Using a dropout of 0.5 the accuracy and loss is highly worsened. Instead by using a dropout of 0.3 the loss is much better (avoid overfitting)
